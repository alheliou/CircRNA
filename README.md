# CircRNA
Pipeline to identify circular RNAs from RNA-seq data.

Dependencies needed:

To use this pipeline you need to have Python 2.X with BioPython installed.

Unfortunately, it won't work with Python 3, we need to work on it.


How to install:

You only need to downlad the repository, it is ready to use


How to run:

We have not yet created an executable.
So, for now you need to use this command line :

python prgm/fenetre.py
