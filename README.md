<b>Description</b>: Pipeline to identify circular RNAs from RNA-seq data.

<b>Dependencies needed</b>:
To use this pipeline you need to have Python 2.X with BioPython installed.
Unfortunately, it won't work with Python 3, we need to work on it.

<b>How to install</b>:
You only need to downlad the repository, it is ready to use

<b>How to run</b>:
We have not yet created an executable.
So, for now you need to use this command line
python prgm/fenetre.py
